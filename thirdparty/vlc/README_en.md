# Third-Party Library: VLC
## Function Introduction
VLC Media Player is a completely free, open-source, cross-platform multimedia player renowned for its powerful compatibility. Its most significant feature is the ability to play the vast majority of audio and video formats available on the market (such as MP4, AVI, MKV, MP3, etc.), as well as DVDs and streaming network protocols, without needing to install any additional codecs or plugins. Developed by a global team of volunteers, the software supports almost all mainstream operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Beyond its core playback functionality, it also provides advanced tools such as video transcoding, screen recording, audio and video effect adjustment, and subtitle synchronization.
