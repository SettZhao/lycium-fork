# vid.stab integrated into the app hap

This library is verified based on the OpenHarmony 3.2 Release version on the RK3568 development board. If you have never used RK3568 before, you can first check the [Runhe RK3568 development board standard system for quick learning](https://gitee.com/openharmony-sig/knowledge_demo_temp/tree/master/docs/rk3568_helloworld)。

## Development environment

- [Development environment preparation](../../../docs/hap_integrate_environment.md)

## Compile third-party libraries
- Download this repository
  ```
  git clone https://gitee.com/openharmony-sig/tpc_c_cplusplus.git --depth=1
  ```
- Third-party library directory structure
  ```
  tpc_c_cplusplus/thirdparty/vlc  #The directory structure of the third-party library vid.stab is as follows
  ├── docs                              #The folders of the documents related to the third-party library
  ├── HPKBUILD                          #Building script
  ├── HPKCHECK                          #Building script

  ```
  
- Compile the third-party library in the lycium directory
  Setting up the compilation environment[Prepare the third-party library building environment](../../../lycium/README.md#1编译环境准备)

  ```
  cd lycium
  ./build.sh vlc
  ```
  Note: The two variables of downloadpackage and autounpack of HPKBUILD can be modified as required. The code can be modified and the latest code can be updated


- Third-party library header file and generated library
  The usr directory is generated in the lycium directory, which contains the compiled 64-bit third-party library
  ```
  vlc/arm64-v8a
  ```

- [Test third-party library](#Test third-party library)

## Use third-party libraries in applications

- Copies the libraries generated by compilation and the dependent libraries\ohos_vlc-master\entry\libs Below, as shown in the following figure
  &nbsp;
  ![thirdparty_install_dir](thirdparty.png)


## Test third-party library
The third-party library test uses the test cases provided by the original library,[Prepare the third-party library test environment](../../../lycium/README.md#3ci环境准备)

- Prepare the executable file and dynamic library generated by compilation

- Link the mobile phone and press the rebulid button to play audio, video, and rtmp videos
